Module 15 Mapping Challenge

All of work is in the starter code folder.

The assignment contains four important parts:
  1. Creating base layers and overlays to outlay geocoded data.
  2. Ensuring the map is functional alongside the default map position and zoom is sensible.
  3. Create and customize (colors and radius) the markers for the data that is being displayed on the map, while also giving details on marker pop-up.
  4. Create a legend to give an easier understanding of the data at glance value instead of having to click individual markers to understand the color relationship.

style.css was slightly edited for the legend. index.html was barely touched from the original starter file. The vast majority of work was completed in the logic.js file. A leaflet-heat.js file was created, but with how the assignment was structured, it would completely turn a lot of it on its head, so I opted out of committing to that.

Thank you for reading! :))
